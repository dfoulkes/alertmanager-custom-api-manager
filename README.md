## Purpose
The Critical Issue Service is a Spring Boot application that provides a RESTful API for managing critical issues 
that are sent from alertmanager. 

In the homelab, there's a scenario where we can use an event from alertmanager
to trigger a system shutdown to avoid data loss or damage to the NAS. 

Although the idea is to manage this use case, we also want to provide a generic API that can be used to manage critical issues in any system.

## Features
- RESTful API for managing critical issues
- Simple pattern for managing alerts and also expandable to other issue types later.


## Test

delete me, testing if the build now increments correctly.
